# circuit-interfaces.md — change log (append-only, newest first)

`docs/circuit-interfaces.md` is frozen as of v0.1 (2026-08-10). Every change lands here
first, in this template, before the doc itself is edited:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line title>
- **Change:** what changed, naming exact identifiers/env vars/paths.
- **Why:** the reason, citing the decision/finding (with date) that forced it.
- **Backward compatible:** yes/no — and for no, what breaks (cache invalidation
  consequences stated explicitly).
- **Mechanism:** how the change is applied (code sites, migration, re-vendor).
  Flag "skill runtime re-vendor required" whenever packages/circuitpy changes.
- **Tracks affected:** pipeline / server / client / skills / docs.
```

## 2026-08-10 — Catalog must surface root `parts.json` as an entry
- **Change:** the client (PartsPanel + BomTable enrichment) reads the parts
  lock through a catalog entry whose `file` is exactly `parts.json` (any
  `kind`), fetching `entry.url` verbatim (`?v=` cache-bust). §2's visibility
  rule "`.json` hidden" gets one more exception alongside the sidecar:
  root `parts.json` is surfaced.
- **Why:** §2 requires "PartsPanel replaces CastPanel (reads parts.json)" but
  names no transport for it; the donor precedent (series.json surfaced despite
  the .json-hidden rule) is the cheapest path and keeps the ?v= refetch
  semantics. Decided while building Track E (2026-08-10).
- **Backward compatible:** yes — if the scanner doesn't surface it, the panel
  and the BOM badges degrade to their empty states; nothing breaks.
- **Tracks affected:** server (catalog visibility rule), client (already
  built to this: `lib/boardModel.js selectPartsEntry`).

(No further entries yet.)
